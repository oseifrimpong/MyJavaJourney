1. Type in the hello world program, then compile and run it.

2. Add a print statement that displays a second message after the “Hello, World!”. Say something witty like, “How are you?” Compile and run the program again.

3. Add a comment to the program (anywhere), recompile, and run it again. The new comment should not affect the result.
